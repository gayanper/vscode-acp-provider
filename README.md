},
```

## Installing

At the moment the extension is under development, so this is not yet published into VSCode market place. But if you want to try out as it is you can install the extension by building it locally and installing into your **VSCode Insider** since this extension relies on some of the experimental APIs only available in VSCode Insider.

To build the extension locally you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gayanperera/vscode-acp-provider.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd vscode-acp-provider
   ```
3. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Build the extension
   ```bash
   npm run package
   ```
5. Open VSCode Insider and install the extension
   - Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
   - Type `Extensions: Install from VSIX...` and select it
   - Browse to the location of the built `.vsix` file (usually in the `vscode-acp-provider` directory) and select it to install

## Usage

After configuring you should see the configured agents in the chat session picker. Select one to start a new chat session with the external agent.
